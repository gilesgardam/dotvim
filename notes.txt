Use :make and quickfix! (Accessible via <leader>m.)

Use <c-x><c-l> to complete whole lines (and look at other :help ins-completion).

Complicated regular expressions are nice enough with /, since you get
highlighting, but can be difficult with :substitute, because you don't. So do
something like /complicatedregex, check highlighting, then use the empty regex
to match it, for example in :%s///g with <leader>r to delete. You can also
<c-r>/ to pull from tHE search register (or any other register).

gi goes into insert mode where you last left it.

ge is the opposite of e, like b is the opposite of w.

gf opens the file whose name is under the cursor.

Dial :h for help (it's quicker).

Use the ex command :norm (e.g. to do something on all visually selected lines).

gu and gU change to lower and upper case respectively (they take motions!).
